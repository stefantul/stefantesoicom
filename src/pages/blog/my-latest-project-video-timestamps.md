Did it ever happened for you to watch a Youtube video and go: "Hmm, this is an interesting bit, I would want to check it later again." And so you like the video, maybe add it on some playlist so you can return to it some other time. Time passes and you remind yourself about some interesting video that you watched some time ago and that it had some interesting bits of information at some point in its timeline. So you go to the 'Liked videos' and start looking for that video through the endless scrolling. Maybe it's there. It's not. So you then start looking for it in some playlist that you created and you find the video that you were looking for. Now, where exactly was that part or those interesting parts again? The video is a one hour long documentary. Time to click random parts of the videos' timeline hopping that maybe with a bit of luck you will land on that interesting part that you cannot remember off. 

This happened to me plenty of times, so many in fact that I needed to do something about it. I tried some existing solutions in the form of browser extensions but couldn't find a proper one, every solution that I tested was lacking something. So I decided to create my own solution to this problem and after a lot of tinkering, tweaking with wrenches and screwdrivers, soldering and welding, forging and casting I finally crafted Something. 

Let me introduce that Something: **Video Timestamps** - the search engine and browser extension. The place where Video Timestamps dwells and calls home is <https://videotimestamps.com> and its doors are open! 

Now when I'm watching some Youtube video, which is something that I often find myself doing, and I stumble upon some interesting bit I can fire up the browser extension, the extension automatically retrieves the video title and the current timestamp and what is left for me is to only give the timestamp a proper description and maybe a tag as well. I click 'Create' and the timestamp is saved in the cloud. You know, the fluffy, Internet cloud.   So I'm not restricted by the fact that the data is saved only locally on my computer and browser - which is what the browser extensions that I have tested do - I can change computers and still be able to access my data. Another good part is that after I create the timestamp and it gets stored in the cloud I can use the Copy feature and Paste it in the Youtube comments section and thus sharing the timestamps with others. And yet another good part is that after the timestamp is saved it can be available in the search engine and be of help to others searching after certain keywords or tags.  

The place which the browser extension calls home can be found [here in Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/create-search-video-times/lcaajcnacljidbdlcalnfhckalkohbej) and guess what? Its doors are also open!  Psst: don't tell anyone but there are (browser) cookies served at the entrance!
