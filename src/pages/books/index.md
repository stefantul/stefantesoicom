  A Story on the Camino is a story about a walk I took on the Spanish Camino back in 2016. A walk that would turn out to be about 1000 kilometers long across rough but beautiful terrain. A walk that would take many days to complete in which I encountered many interesting places, people, self-discovery, misadventures and a lot of unexpected things.
