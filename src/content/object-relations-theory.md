The **object relations theory** states states that the way people relate to others and situations in their adult lives is shaped by family experiences during childhood. For example, someone neglected or abused in infancy would expect similar behavior from others, these images of people and events turn into "objects" that are used by the subconscious to predict people's behavior. Later experiences can shape these objects but objects often continue to exert a strong influence throughout life.
