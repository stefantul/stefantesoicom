## Reward Theory of Attraction

What this theory basically says is that people tend to like (be attracted) to those whom they associate with rewarding events. In other words, people tend to be attracted to those that make them feel good or to those that remind them of people they enjoy being around. If a relationship offers more reward and pleasure than cost and pain than that relationship is more likely to continue.

This theory can explain why no love can feel like the first one: a first love generates new sensations, feelings and a lot of novelty. And this theory can also explain why people tend to be attracted by those that remind them of an ex, whether physically or a similarity in attitudes, gestures, voice, or interests.
