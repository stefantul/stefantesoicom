It's important to always challenge yourself, to get out of your comfort zone, to [set goals and to have systems to achieve them](https://stefantesoi.com/putting-winning-situations/). There can't be growth without getting out of your comfort zone. I've been wanting to run a marathon for about 7-8 years now, yet I haven't succeed yet to achieve this goal because of various reasons. It's time to stop wanting and to start achieving.

The challenge is to run a marathon - 42 kilometers in the next 100 days. Day 1 was yesterday, 18 of March and day 100 will be on 26 of June 2018. Yesterday I've run about 3.5 kilometers in cold, through snow and a patch of ice and did a few ups and downs on a big 55 steps stairway which is about 100 meters from where I live. The weather is a bit problematic at the moment and it seems that it will still be winter until the next week at least. I will be running outdoors only and the compacted snow and ice on the streets is increasing the risk of injury. Hopefully I will not end my journey as soon as I am starting it. I haven't run today but I will do.

I don't have any special training plan, I only have a simple system: to run almost daily and push myself a little bit more each time. Running daily is not a realistic and even recommended because the body needs time to recover. I will make up the plan as I go.

Realistically speaking, I'm a bit reserved towards my chances of achieving this goal. I'm in a relatively good physical shape, I've run before, but I'm quite bad and slow at running! I have bad long-distance running genes (I've done a DNA test a few years back, I will most probably write a future post about genetics), I have fast-twitch muscle fibers, fast-twitch muscles fatigue faster, all the elite marathon runners have slow-twitch muscle which are great for endurance. I have bad running form, my options are limited here because I have a problem, don't like to talk/write about it but I have some limits in the use of my left arm and I can't do the proper arm running movements. I don't know my **[VO2 max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max)** but it's probably lower than the average, I took a test some years ago because I had a pulmonary infection, i'm not sure how the test is called, it's the one where you have to blow as hard as you can into a device - and the doctor asked me if I smoke after reading the results - I'm not a smoker, I tried smoking but didn't found it appealing, smoked 5 cigars tops in my whole life.  Probably my VO2 max improved since then, I'm less sedentary now than in those years.

Like I said earlier, I tried running before, I have my in-built limitations but I'm not a beginner: I succeeded in running semi-marathons before. I participated to an official trail running competition, even though I worked very hard, I  was among the last ones to cross the finish line. What stopped me from running a marathon until now is the lack of consistency I guess,  I had periods of weeks, months and even years in which I didn't run because of various reasons. I don't know about others, but in my first runs after not running for a month or less my lungs are burning like it's the first time I'm running.

This bucket-list goal has been evading me for too long. I will check it off by 26 of June.

I won't be writing daily about how this challenge, goes, I will most probable write an update on day 50, day 99 or day 100 or earlier if something unexpected like breaking a leg happens.

**N.B**: I'm also on day 11 in my challenge to write a post each day for 100 days. I haven't wrote about doing this challenge before, you are finding it now for the first time.
