I don't have to do much convincing in this post on why it's a good idea to #DeleteFacebook because much of it was done already by Facebook and its actions. Actions speak louder than words. This post has already written itself.

Numerous studies on the impact of social media in our lives were made and the consensus is that social media has a negative impact and it [affects our mental health](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2017/06/30/a-run-down-of-social-medias-effects-on-our-mental-health):

**It’s addictive**

**It triggers more sadness, less well-being**

**Comparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy**

**It can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle**

**We get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help**

**More friends on social doesn’t mean you’re more social**

If these arguments are not enough than check out this video with former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya:

"I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works. The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops we’ve created are destroying how society works. No civil discourse, no cooperation; misinformation, mistruth."

Zuckerberg has a team of 12 moderators that manages his Facebook account, posts in his behalf and moderate comments on his page. Twitter's founder, Jack Dorsey doesn't really uses Twitter. There is a saying among drug dealers: "Never get high on your own supply". These founders and executives are intelligent enough to successfully build a highly addictive product and are also intelligent enough to stay away from their creations.

Zuckerberg highly values his privacy, spent more than $30 million to buy 4 neighboring houses for privacy reasons: read the article [here](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-buys-4-homes-for-privacy-2013-10)

At the same time, he doesn't value your privacy, selling your data to the highest bidder or even giving it for free to Intelligence Services like the NSA. If you are not paying, you are the product.

Check out this video, Mark Zuckerberg gets very embarrassed and starts sweating when questioned about Facebook privacy.

These days, Facebook is embroiled in a huge scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, the company's stock value is plummeting and it's getting sued by its investors. The company lost 2.8 million young U.S users in 2017 alone. It seems that the newer generation is smartening up as it becomes more aware of the dangers of social media.  Facebook's fall is predictable and it's happening sooner that I thought it will.
