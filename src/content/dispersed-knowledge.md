The **concept of dispersed knowledge** in economics states that no agent has information to all the factors that influence prices and production throughout the system. In other words, no one has a complete image over everything that is going on at a given time in economy.

One of the first economists to write about this concept,Â **Friedrich Hayek** claimed that "dispersed knowledge is essentially dispersed, and cannot possibly be gathered together and conveyed to an authority charged with the task of deliberately creating order".
