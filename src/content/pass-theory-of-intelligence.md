The **PASS theory of intelligence** states that cognition is organized in three systems and four processes: **Planning** (responsible for controlling & organizing behavior, constructing strategies and monitoring performance), **Attention** (maintains arousal levels and alertness), **Simultaneous Processing and Successive Processing** (encode, transform and retain information).

The **PASS** type of intelligence is tested with the Das-Naglieri **Cognitive Assessment System** (CAS) and unlike other IQ tests, the PASS is capable of diagnosing learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, autism, mental retardation, cognitive changes in aging and Down syndrome.
