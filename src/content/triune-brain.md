The **Triune Brain** is a model for the evolution of the vertebrates brain proposed byÂ the American physician and neuroscientist Paul D. MacLean. The Triune Brain consists of the reptilian complex, the paleomammalian complex (lymbic system) and the neomammalian complex (neocortex).

The **reptilian complex** is responsible for instinctual behaviors involved in aggression, dominance, territoriality and ritual displays.

The **paleomammalian complex** is responsible for the motivation and emotion involved in feeding, reproductive behavior, and parental behavior, mutual reciprocity.

The **neomammalian complex** is responsible for the abilities of language, abstraction, planning and perception.
