## Orthogenesis

The concept of **orthogenesis** is similar to a concept that I wrote about in a previous post, the concept of [Directed Mutagenesis](https://stefantesoi.com/concept-of-the-day-directed-mutagenesis/). Basically, orthogenesis is a hypothesis that organisms have an innate ability to evolve in a certain direction, towards a certain goal (teleology). While this theory was popular at the end of the nineteenth century among biologists like Jean-Baptist Lamarck, nowadays though, the consensus is that evolution is not guided in any way, that mutations occur randomly.

However, the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by genes (**theory of facilitated variation**), for example, different species of the Heliconius butterfly independently evolved similar wing patterns.
