## Ietsism

When asked "Do you believe in God?" the typical ietsist responds "No, but there must be something". The word 'something' is iets in Dutch hence the term ietsism. **Ietsism** is basically the belief in 'something', an undetermined transcendent reality, an English related term being agnostic theism, eclecticism, deism and 'being spiritual but not religious'.

Since ietsists cannot be classified as religious or not religious, ietsism is notoriously known to muck up statistics on religious demographics.
