Deus Vult ("God Wills It") is a Christian motto associated with the Crusades and was first reported in theÂ Gesta Francorum ("The Deeds of the Franks"), a chronicle written in Latin of the First Crusade. Now, for this crypto challenge: in the country associated with the word Francorum, this Catholic military Order was disbanded on the pressure from the country's king. Find out the name of this Order and the cipher used by it and decipher the message. Hints: no more hints, I already made this challenge quite easy.
