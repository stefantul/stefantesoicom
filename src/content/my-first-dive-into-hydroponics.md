I knew about **hydroponics** for a few years now and I've been curios but didn't took any action towards starting my own little "hydro-garden". Well that changed today because today is the day when I started messing with hydroponics a bit. It's an experiment where a lot of things can go wrong and there might be a lot of trial and error.

**What are hydroponics**? For those unfamiliar with this term, hydroponics is about gowning plants in mediums where soil is replaced with water. This is shortest, simplest explanation I can give. You are basically creating a little water world of your own. NASA for example, has been researching hydroponics for a few decades, for reasons easy to understand, they intend to send a hydroponic system on Mars and plan to use LED lighting instead of natural light, this sounds very interesting!

**The start of the Experiment**

What I've done today was to prepare the tomato (the cherry variety) and radish seeds to germinate, made them a comfy bed of cotton in which they should start germinating, sprinkled them with a bit of water and put them to rest.

People usually use a **mineral wool** as the medium of choice in which seeds germinate and develop their strands of roots but I chose to use **cotton wool** instead. I want to keep things as simple and cheap as possible, cotton wool is readily available, most people have in their homes, mineral wool (made by Rockwell) is a bit harder to get and much more expensive.

The box that I used is nothing fancy, is just a box that was laying around and having to purpose. The ratio between tomato and radish seeds is 3:1, which means that I'm hoping and betting more on tomato seedlings to grow up rather than radish seedlings.

This is about it for now, I have to wait a few days and see what will come out of this experiment. I will have to keep the seeds moist so they grow up, for this I'm spraying a mist of water over them from time to time. I will probably write more about this experiment if the seeds will germinate and I will continue to phase two.
