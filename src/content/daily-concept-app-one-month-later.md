It's been more than a month now since I launched one of my recent projects that I've been working on: [The Daily Concept app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.conceptaday&referrer=utm_source%3Dwordpress%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%2520media). The idea behind it is simple as well as the app itself:  it shows a different concept from various domains like Biology, Math, Psychology, Sociology, Religion, Physics, Economics and so on so the idea is to learn something new and interesting day by day.

Sounds like a great idea for an app isn't it? Everyone wants to learn, to grow and to become the best possible versions of themselves! Well, that's what I thought. I got very excited with this idea when I came up with it, inspired by the Word of the Day from Merriam-Webster, and mistakenly thought that there are a lot of people out there that are thinking like me. I've done some research and realized that there is nothing similar on the Internet.

I'm an INTP according to the Myers-Briggs personality test. The INTP personality type is fairly rare, making up about 3 percent of the population, and is characterized by creativity, curiosity,  the strive to discover and learn more about the world around them. The INTP type is also characterized by rational and logical thinking rather than emotional thinking.  It seems that the INTP and INTJ types are the most inclined to want to learn something new each day but I failed in finding and coaxing them so far. The truth is that there are a lot more people, the majority of the population that are not thinking types and would rather spend their time and attention on something fun and entertaining, there is no surprise here, Kim Kardashian or some other celebrity of the day will always have much more followers than the concept of the day.

So, the promotion that I did for the past 30+ days was to post on 14 social media sites a screenshot from my phone with the concept of the day, along with the title, short description, download link for the app and tags. The screenshot doesn't shows the whole description of the concept, only the first few lines, I thought that this would translate into more downloads.

I tried to automate this process as much as I could so it doesn't take me much time to do the posting. I'm getting followers, some interactions in the form of likes and retweets/reblogs but that's about it.

Judging by the first month's metrics, it seems that this app will turn to be yet another failed idea. I'm not giving up on the app, I will do some minor tweaks to the app and continue to promote it on social media for at least one more month. Because of the high probability of failure is not worth investing too much time and energy into this project.

For the few active users of the app: you don't have to worry about this, the app will continue to automatically show something new each day until the end of the year!  There are a lot of new concepts to be learned so keep an open mind and enjoy!
