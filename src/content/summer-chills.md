At the beginning of this month I wrote about the [Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR)](https://stefantesoi.com/autonomous-sensory-meridian-response/), a term with a lot of sophisticated words used to describe a common feeling of tingling that starts from the top of the head and continues down the spine. We all know and experienced that feeling, I don't think that there is a person that haven't, but only few of us know the scientific term for it.

Where I'm trying to get is here: I've also experienced in the past, as a matter of fact not long ago, during a run a few days ago, and most probably will experience this sensation in the future. I don't know exactly how it's called, didn't found out the scientific term for it yet, if there is one. I searched and didn't found anything relevant, if you know what I'm talking about and know more details than I do, feel free to send a comment. I can only describe it: I feel this sensation only during hot days, usually summer, the scenario is this: it's hot outside, I go outside for a walk or a run, I heat up, start sweating, start feeling hotter and hotter and then, suddenly, I feel a chill and feel like I'm cooling down - only that it seems like a fake cooling, I don't think I actually cooling down.

From what I found, the explanation for this phenomenon could be this one: when you overheat the blood retreats from the extremities and your skin, the blood vessels constrict. When the warm blood starts retreating from the skin it causes the skin to "cool off'. This is what I've found so far, it might be a body feature designed by evolution to deal with heat. I just named it "summer chills".
