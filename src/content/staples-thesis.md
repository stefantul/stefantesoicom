The **staples thesis** is a theory of export-led growth based on Canadian experience and that explains the development of the Canadian economy as lateral, east-west conception of trade. Scholar Harold Innis believed that Canada developed the way it did due to the nature of its staples economy: raw materials such as cod (in Atlantic Canada), fur (Central Canada), lumber, wheat (Western Canada) and minerals that were exported Britain and the West Indies. This type of trade strengthened Canada's cultural ties with Britain and led to the creation of institutions that that defined the political environment in the country.
