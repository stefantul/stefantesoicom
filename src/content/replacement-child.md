Painters **Vincent van Gogh** and **Salvador Dali** are examples of "resurrected" children, they both had brothers of the same name who died before their birth.  Replacement children are usually over-protected by their parents.

The term **replacement child** is a term invented in 1964 by psychologists **Albert C. Cain and Barbara S. Cain** and it refers to a child conceived shortly after the parents have lost another child.
