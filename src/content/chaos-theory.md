## Chaos Theory

\[caption id="attachment\_554" align="aligncenter" width="500"\]![Chaos Theory - The Daily Concept](https://stefantesoi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/The-Daily-Concept.png) Chaos Theory - The Daily Concept\[/caption\]

The essence of the chaos theory can be summarized in the following quote by Edward Lorenz:

> Chaos: When the present determines the future, but the approximate present does not approximately determine the future.

In some cases deterministic systems are unpredictable due to the element of chaos and small differences in initial conditions can produce widely diverging outcomes: for example, the **butterfly effect**, a butterfly flapping its wings in Africa can cause a hurricane in Texas.

Chaos behavior appears in many natural systems such as weather and climate.
