In computer science, a **model of computation** is a model that describes how a set of outputs are computed given a set of inputs. Examples of models of computation:

Sequential models: Finite State Machines, Turing Machine

Functional models: Lambda Calculus, Recursive functions, Cellular automaton

Concurrent models: Petri nets, Kahn process networks.
