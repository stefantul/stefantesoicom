**Multiomics** is a new research methodology in biology in which multiple "omes" data sets are used such as genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, and microbiome. The purpose of combining these data sets is to make the analysis of complex big data more efficiently and to find biomarkers more easily.

For example, in order to find [suicide](https://stefantesoi.com/the-werther-effect/) markers in depressed patients, blood sample is collected and subjected to genome, transcriptome and epigenome sequencing to find a common significant marker in that population.
