## Anomie

\[caption id="attachment\_566" align="aligncenter" width="500"\]![Anomie - The Daily Concept](https://stefantesoi.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/The-Daily-Concept-3.png) Anomie - The Daily Concept\[/caption\]

The state of **anomie** occurs when society offers little moral guidance to individuals, it's the breakdown of social bonds between individual and society, the fragmentation of identity. This concept was popularized in 1897 by the French sociologist **Emile Durkheim**. According to Durkheim, anomie usually occurs when there is a mismatch between individual or group standards and wider social standards or from the lack of a social ethic.

**Examples**: an individual that strives to achieve the common goals of a certain society might use a behavior that violates social norms, if he can't achieve these goals legitimately because of the structural limits in the society.

Another anomie example occurs among tourists:

> "travel has the advantage of permitting the traveller to behave in a manner normally circumvented by the dictates of convention. When on holiday the tourist can overstep the bounds of fashion, tell a few stories normally deemed improper or inappropriate, wear flashy clothes, eat exotic food, get drunk, become more sexually permissive, alter his timetable, stay up half the night, listen to loud local music, etc., in short, indulge in those kinds of behavior generally frowned upon in his home environment."
