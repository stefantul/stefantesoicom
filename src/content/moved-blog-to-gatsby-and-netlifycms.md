Goodbye Wordpress! You did a pretty good job keeping this blog together for the first two years of its life but now it's the time to take things to the next level and transform this blog into a static site with the help of Gatsby and NetlifyCMS. Yes, it's true that Wordpress is easy to use and appeals to a lot of people that don't want too much hassle when it comes to a CMS for their blogs but this ease of use comes at a cost. Yes, it's true that Gatsby requires a level of technical skill that a lot of people don't have and that you have to get your hands dirty to get things up and running but the advantages fully justify the effort: high Lighthouse audit score out of the box, lighthing speed when is also used in conjucture with a CDN such as the one provided free by Netlify, great SEO, offline access, page caching, security and many others. Last but not least I don't have to pay for hosting due to NetlifyCMS, all the blog posts and media files are hosted for free on Github. No more paying $30 a year just for hosting a low traffic blog such as mine - no more dealing with a provider like Namecheap, they were great in the beginning but it seems lately that making money took priority over offering better services and better support.
